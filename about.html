        <p class="font-parag">After graduating in 2019 from the Liceo Marconi Delpino in Chiavari, I initially undertook
            studies as a Laboratory Technician at the University of Genoa. <br> However, I soon realised that path
            did not suit me, leading me to reflect on what I really wanted to do in life. <br>
            The answer became clear: create <strong>video games</strong>.</p>

        <p class="font-parag">In 2022, I therefore enrolled in the Game Design and Development course at the Vigamus Academy
            in Rome, moving to the capital to follow my passion. During the course, I was able to delve
            into different aspects of game design and work on numerous projects. </p>

        <p class="font-parag">After obtaining my
            certification, I started collaborating with former classmates and other professionals to develop
            <a href="https://www.mindscrapergame.com/home" target="_blank"><strong>Mind Scraper</strong></a>, a graphic adventure in Unity that allows players to discover worlds generated by people's minds. <br>The project's demo was awarded second place at the third edition of Zagarolo Gamehouse,
            a competition promoted by the Lazio Region, which allowed us to meet with experts in the field,
            including professionals from One-O-One Games. <br>Subsequently, an improved version of the demo was
            presented at First Playable 2024 in Florence, receiving positive feedback from the public and experts.</p>

        <p class="font-parag">In 2025, I also undertook a course to obtain the qualification as <strong>Full-Stack Programmer</strong>,
            in order to expand my programming skills and further enhance my professionalism in the field.</p>
