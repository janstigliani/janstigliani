                 After graduating in 2019 from the Liceo Marconi Delpino in Chiavari, I initially undertook
                studies as a Laboratory Technician at the University of Genoa. <br> However, I soon realised that path
                did not suit me, leading me to reflect on what I really wanted to do in life. <br>
                The answer became clear: create <strong>video games</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="written parag">
                In 2022, I therefore enrolled in the Game Design and Development course at the Vigamus Academy
                in Rome, moving to the capital to follow my passion. During the course, I was able to delve
                into different aspects of game design and work on numerous projects. <br> After obtaining my
                certification, I started collaborating with former classmates and other professionals to develop
                <a href="https://www.mindscrapergame.com/home" target="_blank"><span class="nav"><strong>Mind Scraper</strong></span></a>, a graphic adventure in Unity that allows players to discover worlds generated by people's minds.
            </p>

            <p class="written parag">
                The project's demo was awarded second place at the third edition of Zagarolo Gamehouse,
                a competition promoted by the Lazio Region, which allowed us to meet with experts in the field,
                including professionals from One-O-One Games. <br>Subsequently, an improved version of the demo was
                presented at First Playable 2024 in Florence, receiving positive feedback from the public and experts.
            </p>

            <p class="written parag">
                In 2025, I also undertook a course to obtain the qualification as <strong>Full-Stack Programmer</strong>,
                in order to expand my programming skills and further enhance my professionalism in the field.
